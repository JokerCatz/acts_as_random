acts_as_random
============
Easy & Fast way to rand in model

[model]
    acts_as_random
or
    acts_as_random :count => 10

then

    Item.pick => @item(rand)
    Item.picks => Array (default length is 3)

and you can choice algorithms

default algorithms is [id > rand(max(id) - min(id))].first

then you can use

    acts_as_random :rand_by_offset => true

to set random by offset : [offset by (Ruby rand[model count])]

default is very fast . but it's uneven , choice rand_by_offset will average :)
